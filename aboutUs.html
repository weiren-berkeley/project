          <p>The Open Architecture Robotic Platform is a project
						required the team to design a software platform to
						control an associated robotic arm. A robotic arm is made
						by previous students, and sufficient changes are required
						to make it fit our project. The software includes control
						functions and UI design. In general, the project embedded
						control, programming, hardware design knowledge.

						After multiple rounds of user research, the team decided to target control engineer as audience. After talk with several PhD students and professors, it is found that platform they are using now cannot serve all needs cheaply and conveniently. The most popular competitive product is ROS, as known as Robotics Operating System, which is a framework includes tools and libraries to control a robot. While ROS provides more solution in low-level tasks like sensor access, this project want to provide assistance in high-level tasks like arm controller and perception. In conclude, our goal is to provide control engineers a low-cost platform with all necessary commands that they can directly compose control algorithm with them. And they can use the robotic arm to test their theory. Basic control commands should be well defined with LabVIEW. In addition, a GUI should be provided to user to visually see their code and feedback. Moreover, the project is expected to be marketable. To achieve this, the team will keep digging other user needs while prototyping. For example, the team should consider how to link the needs of research to the needs of the industry.
